# license

## tl;dr

build whatever you want with re:frame. use it for personal projects, commercial
apps, client work, saas products — it's yours to build with. the only thing you
can't do is resell re:frame itself as a competing product. and even that
restriction expires — every release becomes plain mit after 90 days, at which
point you can do literally anything with it. need full commercial rights to the
latest releases right now? get in touch about an enterprise license at

## terms and conditions

### licensor ("we")

the party offering the software under these terms and conditions.

### the software

the "software" is each version of the software that we make available under
these terms and conditions, as indicated by our inclusion of these terms and
conditions with the software.

### license grant

subject to your compliance with this license grant and the patents,
redistribution and trademark clauses below, we hereby grant you the right to
use, copy, modify, create derivative works, publicly perform, publicly display
and redistribute the software for any permitted purpose identified below.

### permitted purpose

a "permitted purpose" is any purpose other than a "competing use." a "competing
use" means making the software available to third parties in a commercial
product or service that:

1. substitutes for the software;

2. substitutes for any other product or service we offer using the software that
   exists as of the date we make the software available; or

3. offers the same or substantially similar functionality as the software.

permitted purposes specifically include using the software:

1. for your internal use and access;

2. for non-commercial education;

3. for non-commercial research; and

4. in connection with professional services you provide to a licensee using the
   software in accordance with these terms and conditions.

### patents

to the extent your use for a permitted purpose would necessarily infringe our
patents, the license grant above includes a license under our patents. if you
make a claim against any party that the software infringes or contributes to the
infringement of any patent, then your patent license to the software ends
immediately.

### redistribution

the terms and conditions apply to all copies, modifications and derivatives of
the software.

if you redistribute any copies, modifications or derivatives of the software,
you must include a copy of or a link to these terms and conditions and not
remove any copyright notices provided in or with the software.

### disclaimer

the software is provided "as is" and without warranties of any kind, express or
implied, including without limitation warranties of fitness for a particular
purpose, merchantability, title or non-infringement.

in no event will we have any liability to you arising out of or related to the
software, including indirect, special, incidental or consequential damages, even
if we have been informed of their possibility in advance.

### trademarks

except for displaying the license details and identifying us as the origin of
the software, you have no right under these terms and conditions to use our
trademarks, trade names, service marks or product names.

### termination

if you use the software in violation of these terms and conditions, your rights
under this license will terminate automatically. if we notify you of your
violation and you cease all violations within 30 days of receiving that notice,
your rights will be reinstated. however, if you violate these terms again after
reinstatement, your rights will terminate permanently.

### severability

if any provision of these terms and conditions is found to be unenforceable, the
remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.

### grant of future license

we hereby irrevocably grant you an additional license to use the software under
the mit license that is effective 3 months (90 days) after the date we make each
version of the software available.

once that period has passed for a given version, the mit license shall apply to
that version as if it had been licensed under it from the start.

## enterprise licensing

for commercial use that falls outside the permitted purposes above, enterprise
licenses are available with additional benefits including support,
indemnification, and custom terms.
